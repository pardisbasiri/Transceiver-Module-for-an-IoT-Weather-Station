# Transceiver-Module-for-an-IoT-Weather-Station

A transceiver module for an IoT weather station with the capability to receive and process digital signals from a weather center.

It includes logic to update temperature, humidity, and wind parameters based on received signals. The transceiver operates within a specified time window, from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM, daily, and is controlled by clock and reset signals. The code incorporates a time-based enable signal that allows the transceiver to function during the designated hours. However, to use this code effectively, you need to provide external interfaces for signal reception, clock, and reset, and perform thorough testing to ensure proper functionality.
